# Biography
Dechao Tian is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Computational Biology Department at Carnegie Mellon University.
He currently develops statistical models and machine learning algorithms to explore the potential connections between the spatial chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation networks.
His long-term goal is to integrate single-cell data from multiple modalities to systematically study complex biological systems.
