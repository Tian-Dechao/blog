# Biography
Dechao Tian is a ORISE Fellow at Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
He currently develops statistical models and machine learning algorithms to explore the potential connections between the spatial chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation networks.
His long-term goal is to integrate single-cell data from multiple modalities to systematically study complex biological systems.
