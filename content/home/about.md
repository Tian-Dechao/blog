# Biography
Dechao Tian is a Postdoctoral Research Associate of computational biology at Carnegie Mellon University.
Dechao currently explores potential connections between the 3D chromosomal connectome and transcriptional regulation, aiming to discover interesting principal connections and develop algorithms. For example, he is interested in using latent Graphical models to infer direct transcriptional regulations.
